Upon entering this room you are near blinded by glimmering gold, piles of gems, endless stacks of platters and armour and goblets; oh my! A small chamber, lit by enchanted and never flickering candles. You see words carved into the stone, all around the room like written trim, in an archaic but not unknown language. You can see a “T” shaped hole on one of the walls.

You have solved the puzzle so you can move through the room safely. To your right you see a white oak door and to your left a gilded door.
