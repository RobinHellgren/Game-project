Dining Room Scene

The room is enormous and rich with the aroma of a thousand delicious dishes, all sprawled along the long table; festooned with flowers, candles, and ceaseless cutlery. Your stomach rumbles so loudly, you begin to reach for your weapon, thinking a beast is behind you.

At the end of a table a open door leads into a pitch black darkness and at the other end of the room a ornate door looms.
