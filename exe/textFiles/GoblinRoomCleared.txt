Goblin Room

At you feet lies the defeated goblin, his murderous streak finally put to an end by you. Your town elder would be proud of you.

The room looks to be a storage room used to store food and beverages, on a nearby table a feast is prepared. Your assume that this is what the goblin was doing before you got her. The door to your left leads back to the room you entered to tower from and to your right is an open door, and illuminated table is in view with plates and cup laid out across it.
