Throne Room Scene

You enter an enormous chamber lit by clever channels of oil carved into the walls and floors; grey stone like the others, but dominated at its center by a plush carpet and ornate throne chair of dark carved wood. The room is smaller than some of the others you’ve seen along your journey, but it conveys a sense of clandestine behaviour; a sort of esoteric exclusion. 

You feel, deep in your bones, that you should not be here, and for the first time you are aware of your fear. There is no wondering about the room. You know you must sit in the Throne. But how could you ever know what will happen?

To your left there's a gilded door marked "Treasure room" and to your back there's a gilded door marked with a question mark.
