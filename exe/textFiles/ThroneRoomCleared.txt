Throne Room Scene

You enter an enormous chamber lit by clever channels of oil carved into the walls and floors; grey stone like the others, but dominated at its center by a plush carpet and the throne from earlier lies smashed on the floor. The room is smaller than some of the others you’ve seen along your journey, but it conveys a sense of clandestine behaviour; a sort of esoteric exclusion. 

To your left there's a gilded door marked "Treasure room" and to your back there's a gilded door marked with a question mark.
