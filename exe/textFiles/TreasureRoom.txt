Treasure Room

Upon entering this room you are near blinded by glimmering gold, piles of gems, endless stacks of platters and armour and goblets; oh my! A small chamber, lit by enchanted and never flickering candles. You see words carved into the stone, all around the room like written trim, in an archaic but not unknown language. You can see a “T” shaped hole on one of the walls.

You can cobble together enough of the phrase to understand that you must not touch anything in the room, unless you want to be buried alive. But you also know there MUST be a “key” to passing through this room. What could it be? Choose wisely.
