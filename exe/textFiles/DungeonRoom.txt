Dungeon Room Scene
You enter the tower and start you adventure.

You’ve entered a rotunda with 3 doors. The walls are grey stone like the rest of the labyrinth has been, but the doors are made out of rich, vibrant, well-polished woods; each from a different tree. 

To your left, a door of white oak, sturdy and sunny and bright. To your right, a door of red ash, a stolid and brickish colour. In the middle, a door of mahogany, rich and dark; each is held in place by sturdy yet ornate hinges of wrought iron. Which will you choose?
