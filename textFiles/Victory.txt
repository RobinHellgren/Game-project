Victory

You write “knowledge” on the vellum and the room is engulfed in magical energy infusing you with newfound power!

You have won! You’ve shown not only strength and courage, but you’ve finally understood the motivations of the Red Robes, and why they froze your world. You now have an understanding of magic that NO ONE else does; use it wisely, and you will be revered as a hero for all your days.
