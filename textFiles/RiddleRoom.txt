Riddle Room

An unassuming room, with a single, slim, but somehow sunny, arrowslit, a sparse writing desk with inkwell and vellum, and a wobbly armless chair. You look around the room, and then sit in the chair. A single word appears on the scroll in front of you. “Why?”. 

With all the information you’ve collected so far, you must dare to guess at the motive of the Red Robes. Why did they freeze time in your world? What had they hoped to gain? You take the quill from the inkwell, and steady your hand as you set the tip to the vellum. Why, indeed?

On the opposite end of the desk there's a mahogany door, next to the desk you see a gilded door and next to the left there's and ornate door.
