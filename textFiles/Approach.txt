Approaching The Tower

After a very long trek through thick forests, you come to a wide, sun-drenched clearing. There is a well-trodden path directly through its center, leading to the most unsettling structure you have ever seen. Reaching high above the trees surrounding it, sinister black spires twist and stretch toward the sky. Odd, sharp angles jut out in every direction, and you wonder for a moment what exactly the architect must have been smoking. 
But you know no mere mortal created this tower; there’s an unseen shimmering, a subtle sense of uneasy, that reeks of magic all throughout the clearing. You wipe your brow, slow your breath, and continue up the path.

But first; Who are you?
