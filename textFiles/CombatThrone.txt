Fight Animated Chair Scene 

As soon as you settle into the Throne, it bolts and bucks and throws you to the floor. You shake off the blow and look up in astonishment as the throne screams to life; warping and wailing as the wood stretches and shapes into the most horrific figure of an enormous bull-headed, winged, many-clawed monster...and yet, still chair-shaped, somehow. 

This magical beast has never been seen before on this world. Its head rears up just behind yours, showing a terrifying array of sharp teeth and glowing red eyes, as it unleashes a horrific screech. You dart away from the chair but cannot put enough space between you and this demon before he grabs you...
